# ling-490-final

The following database covers 3 folktales elicited from a speaker of the Saru dialect of Hokkaido Ainu, Kimi Kimura. The three folktales are:
  1. Pananpe Escapes from the Demonâ€™s Hands
  2. The Girl Who Gave the Bad Red Dog Poison
  3. The Young Lad Raised by the Cat God

The purpose of this data was to analyze the narrative structure of Hokkaido Ainu folktales under not only a Labovian narrative structure, but also through the lens of the
concept of "small" stories. 

The following .csv files are available:
  1. ain-narrative.csv
         includes the line number in association with the story along with the Hokkaido Ainu transcriptions, English gloss, English translation, and Japanese translation.
  3. gloss_key.csv
         includes the abbreviated and unabbreviated forms of the gloss
  5. notes.csv
         makes note of what changes occured to the data
  7. structure_type.csv
         aligns each line of the folktales with its structure type according to Labovian structure and whether a "small" story occurs. These were made via personal judgements.
