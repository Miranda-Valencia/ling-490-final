The following database covers 3 folktales elicited from a speaker of the Saru dialect of Hokkaido Ainu, Kimi Kimura. The three folktales are:
  1. Pananpe Escapes from the Demonâ€™s Hands
  2. The Girl Who Gave the Bad Red Dog Poison
  3. The Young Lad Raised by the Cat God

The purpose of this data was to analyze the narrative structure of Hokkaido Ainu folktales under not only a Labovian narrative structure, but also through the lens of the
concept of "small" stories.
